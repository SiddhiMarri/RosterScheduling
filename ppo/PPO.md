# Workflow Integration

## Observation

- **PPO** receives the current state of all controllers from the environment.

## Action (Priority Assignment)

- **PPO** assigns priority scores to each controller, reflecting their suitability for the current scheduling slot.

## Optimization (LP Execution)

- These priority scores are fed into the **LP model**, which computes the optimal assignments of controllers to positions while respecting all constraints.

## Environment Update

- The environment updates controller states based on the assignments and progresses the scheduling timeline.

## Reward Calculation

- The system calculates a reward based on the effectiveness of the assignments (e.g., successful position fulfillment, balanced workloads).

## Policy Update

- **PPO** uses the received reward to adjust its policy, aiming to improve future priority score assignments for better scheduling outcomes.

# Synergy Between PPO and LP

### PPO's Adaptability

- **PPO** dynamically learns to prioritize controllers based on evolving states and past performance, allowing the system to adapt to changing conditions.

### LP's Precision

- **LP** ensures that assignments are optimized within the defined constraints, providing a reliable and feasible scheduling solution every time.

### Continuous Improvement

- The feedback loop between **PPO** and **LP** allows the RL agent to refine its priority assignments over time, leading to increasingly efficient and fair scheduling decisions.

# Benefits of Integration

### Efficiency

- Combines the strengths of **RL** (learning from interaction) with the rigor of optimization techniques.

### Scalability

- Capable of handling complex scheduling scenarios with numerous controllers and constraints.

### Constraint Compliance

- Guarantees that all operational rules are strictly followed through **LP**, while **PPO** focuses on optimizing priorities within those rules.

### Adaptability

- Allows the system to continuously improve and adapt to new patterns or changes in controller states and scheduling requirements.
